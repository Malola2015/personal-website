Not surprisingly, there are several technical solutions to detect falls, however, none of them has achieved great acceptance. The popularization of smartwatches provides a promising tool to address this problem. In this work, we present a solution that applies machine learning techniques to process the output of a smartwatch accelerometer, being able to detect a fall event with high accuracy. To this end, we simulated the two most common types of falls in elders, gathering acceleration data from the wrist, then applied that data to train two classifiers. The results show high accuracy and robust classifiers able to detect falls.},

Since their invention, a variety of designs have been proposed, yet most of them have been successfully attacked. In this paper we focus on a new HIP, based on a puzzle solving scheme, created to increase both security and usability: the Capy CAPTCHA. We have analyzed its design, finding some important flaws. Based on them, we propose a low-cost, side-channel attack. Initial results show that the attack is able to break Capy with a 61\% success ratio.},

	abstract={Run-time analysis is a type of empirical tool that studies the time consumed by running an algorithm. This type of analysis has been successfully used in some Artificial Intelligence (AI) fields, in paticular in Metaheuristics. This paper is an attempt to bring this tool to the path-planning community. In particular, we analyse the statistical properties of the run-time of the A*, Theta* and S-Theta* algorithms with a variety of problems of different degrees of complexity. Traditionally, the path-planning literature has compared run-times just comparing their mean values. This practice, which unfortunately is quite common in the literature, raises serious concerns from a methodological and statistical point of view. Simple mean comparison provides poorly supported conclusions, and, in general, it can be said that this practice should be avoided.
			After our analysis, we conclude that the time required by these three algorithms follows a lognormal distribution. In low complexity problems, the lognormal distribution looses some accuracy to describe the algorithm run-times. The lognormality of the run-times opens the use of powerful parametric statistics to compare execution times, which could lead to stronger empirical methods.},

These measures, mainly computational effort and number of individuals to be processed, estimate the performance of the algorithm as well as the difficulty of a problem. Although Koza's performance measures have been widely used in the literature, their behaviour is not well known. In this paper we study the accuracy of these measures and advance in the understanding of the factors that influence them. In order to achieve this goal, we report an empirical study that attempts to systematically measure the effects of two variability sources in the estimation of the number of individuals to be processed and the computational effort. The results obtained in those experiments suggests that these measures, in common experimental setups, and under certain circumstances, might have a high relative error.}

    abstract = {Run-time analysis is a method that characterizes the run-time behaviour of an algorithm. It has been successfully used to analyse metaheuristics and stochastic local search algorithms. Some studies on genetic programming and related stochastic search algorithms suggested the existence of a rationale behind the run-time behaviour which could be exploited to better understand the algorithm looking at its run-time response. Under that hypothesis, this paper presents empirical evidence suggesting common statistical properties in the run-time of several types of population-based search algorithms, including genetic algorithms, genetic programming, grammatical evolution, differential evolution or particle swarm optimization. In this analysis, only the run-time of runs that were able to find a solution are considered; unsuccessful runs are not included in the analysis. The run-time to find a solution, measured by the number of evaluations, of some well-known evolutionary algorithms is empirically obtained, finding that it usually can be approximated using a lognormal distribution, with the exception of some difficult problems, which are better approximated by an exponential. We also show that the algorithm parameter settings might influence the yielding run-time statistical distribution; in particular, when there is no selective pressure, the run-time, measured as the number of evaluations to find a solution, follows a Weibull distribution instead of a lognormal one. Finally, we outline a framework using a simple theoretical discrete-time model, showing that the geometrically distributed run-time is a consequence of the lack of memory in the algorithm.},

Despite the importance of these metrics, and the doubts that they have generated in many authors, their reliability has attracted little research attention, and is still not well understood. The lack of knowledge about these metrics has likely contributed to the decline in their usage in the last years. This paper is an attempt to increase the knowledge about these measures, exploring in which circumstances they are more reliable, providing some clues to improve how they are used, and eventually making their use more justifiable. Specifically, we investigate the amount of uncertainty associated with the measures, taking an analytical and empirical approach and reaching theoretical boundaries to the error. Additionally, a new method to calculate Koza's performance measures is presented. It is shown that these metrics, under common experimental configurations, have an unacceptable error, which can be arbitrary large in certain conditions.},

Given two points in a map, path-planning algorithms search for a path that joins those two points, avoiding obstacles. It is a challenging problem with important practical applications in a wide range of applications: autonomous mobile robotics, logistics or video games, just to mention some of them. Given its importance, it has attracted much research, resulting in a large number of algorithms, some classical, such as A*, other more specialized, such as swarms. However, despite all the literature dedicated to this problem, the statistics used to analyze experimental results in most cases are naïve. In this paper, we position in favor of the need of incorporating stronger statistical methods in path-planning empirical research and promote a debate in the research community. To this end, we analyze some 2D-grid classical path-planning algorithms in discrete domains (i.e. A* and A* with post-processing) and more recent algorithms in continuous domains (i.e. Theta* and S-Theta*). Given the differences of these algorithms, we study them under different criteria: Run-time, number of heading changes, number of expanded vertices and path-length.}

abstract = {Radio frequency identification (RFID) is a powerful technology that enables wireless information storage and control in an economical way. These properties have generated a wide range of applications in different areas. Due to economic and technological constrains, RFID devices are seriously limited, having small or even tiny computational capabilities. This issue is particularly challenging from the security point of view. Security protocols in RFID environments have to deal with strong computational limitations, and classical protocols cannot be used in this context. There have been several attempts to overcome these limitations in the form of new lightweight security protocols designed to be used in very constrained (sometimes called ultra-lightweight) RFID environments. One of these proposals is the David-Prasad ultra-lightweight authentication protocol. This protocol was successfully attacked using a cryptanalysis technique named Tango attack. The capacity of the attack depends on a set of boolean approximations. In this paper, we present an enhanced version of the Tango attack, named Genetic Tango attack, that uses Genetic Programming to design those approximations, easing the generation of automatic cryptanalysis and improving its power compared to a manually designed attack. Experimental results are given to illustrate the effectiveness of this new attack.},

Probably one of the most important ones is the shipping planning, i.e. plan the routes that the shippers have to follow to deliver the goods. In this article, we present an artificial intelligence-based solution that has been designed to help a logistic company to improve its routes planning process. In order to achieve this goal, the solution uses the knowledge acquired by the company drivers to propose optimised routes. Hence, the proposed solution gathers the experience of the drivers, processes it and optimises the delivery process. The solution uses data mining to extract knowledge from the company information systems and prepares it for analysis with a case-based reasoning (CBR) algorithm. The CBR obtains critical business intelligence knowledge from the drivers experience that is needed by the planner. The design of the routes is done by a genetic algorithm that, given the processed information, optimises the routes following several objectives, such as minimise the distance or time. Experimentation shows that the proposed approach is able to find routes that improve, on average, the routes made by the human experts.},

These techniques can be used to help users who have to go to a building with several floors, corridors, and departments to get its right location and orientation. The problem gets more complicated when there are a high number of visitors with temporal constraints. Typically the lack of information and signs to guide the user complicates this task. A typical example is a hospital, where patients have scheduled doctor's appointments and in some cases movement problems (handicaps). A possibility for solving this problem is to equip the building with an intelligent system for user detection and orientation.

		  In this article we present a solution that uses a detection and a location system based on wireless technology and artificial intelligence techniques to plan and inform about the paths the user can follow.}

They are able to efficiently exploit historical information in the evolution process to look for optimal solutions or approximate themfor a given problem, achieving excellent performance in optimization problems that involve a large set of dependent variables. Despite the excellent results of GAs, their use may generate new problems. One of them is how to provide a good fitting in the usually large number of parameters that must be tuned to allow a good performance. This paper describes a new platform that is able to extract the Regular Expression that matches a set of examples, using a supervised learning and agent-based framework. In order to do that, GA-based agents decompose the GA execution in a distributed sequence of operations performed by them. The platform has been applied to Language induction problem, for that reason the experiments are focused on the extraction of the regular expression that matches a set of examples. Finally, the paper shows the efficiency of the proposed platform (in terms of fitness value) applied to three case studies: emails, phone numbers and URLs. Moreover, it is described how the codification of the alphabet affects to the performance of the platform.},
